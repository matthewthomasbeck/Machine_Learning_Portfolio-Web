# Machine_Learning_Portfolio-Frontend
Front end is kind of a strong phrase, what this really does is communicate to my website to display my findings.

Note: I do not own any of the data provided by the API's I use, and I do not make any money with this code, the copyrights are mainly there to make sure people don't steal my hours and hours of hard work, as I unfortunately know a few people who would absolutely try to do so. If you have any concerns, please contact me on my LinkedIn at https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthewthomasbeck/ and I will be happy to help.
